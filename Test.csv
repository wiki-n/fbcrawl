Jim Gilday,,2019-04-25,I’ve been asked numerous times “How’s Retirement treating you”? The question should be “How am I treating Retirement “? The answer is that it’s a beautiful thing and I never get bored with nothing to do. I’ve seen a lot of people come and go in my almost 34 years working and many will never get the opportunity. That makes me realize I am a Blessed man 🙏,19,19,,,,,,5,10215539344689118,/story.php?story_fbid=10215539344689118&id=1004605694

Jim Gilday,,2019-04-19,"This is from Kid Rock. Basically, you’re always looking at someone else and thinking about how good you think they have it. But, it’s only from the outside looking in. He’s worth $80mil the last time I checked and he’s wishing he had my life? Look up the song and listen for yourself.
